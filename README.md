# Team_GEM_Project

## Team Members:
* Gina Freed, Eliot Cleveland, Marc Leslie

## Project Questions:
* What national-level factors correlate with rates of COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccinations?  And when those national-level factors don't really work out so well, what _else_ can we look at that may correlate?

## Dependent Variables:
* COVID-19 cases per million population\
* COVID-19 deaths per million population\
* Persons vaccinated per hundred population\
* Total population\
* (Data Source: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

## Independent Variables
* **GDP**: monetary measure of the market value of all the goods and services produced in a country in a year\
* **Human Development Index (HDI)**: Published by United Nations Development Programme (http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi), an index that combines life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling, mean years of schooling, and GNI per capita\
* **The Corruptions Perception Index**: Published by Transparency International (https://www.transparency.org) which ranks and scores 180 countries by their "perceived levels of public sector corruption."\
* **Quality of Life Index**: Published by Numbeo (https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp) this index scores countries by measures such as health care access and quality, cost of living, and purchasing power. 

## First Steps (or - how our hopes were dashed):
1. Data set cleaned to remove certain columns and to create a cumulative number of COVID cases and deaths.
2. We realized that the vaccination data is not adequete for analysis - very few countries reporting the data and just not enough information to work with.
3. Scatterplots were run to see if our independent variables correlated with our dependent variables.  This did not yield enough fruit to keep this line of analysis going.
4. We realized that the level of analysis is just too _big_.  GDP is too broad a measure; cases or deaths by country 

## Now what?
